- Scrolling down, you're presented with time blocks dedicated to standard business hours.
- Time blocks are color-coded for clarity, indicating whether the time slot is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
- Clicking into a time block lets you enter an event or task for that period.
- Save your tasks by clicking the save button for each time block. Your entries are securely saved in local storage.
